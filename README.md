# Unit Test Practice

This is an area to practice unit-testing
in code having off-the-shelf dependencies.
In fact, this code doesn't have anything more.
Think nothing can go wrong? Think again!

The task is to read this excel:

![excel-sample](email-sample.png)

...then send email information to employees about their hike.

Is it easy to read this excel file in python?
See [this file](read-excel-poc.py) for an implementation to read and print its contents -
it's a couple of lines of code.
